## Format guide

Emit every call of a turn inside one section. Each call is an id of the fixed form `functions.NAME:INDEX` followed by one JSON arguments object:

```text
<|tool_calls_section_begin|><|tool_call_begin|>functions.NAME:INDEX<|tool_call_argument_begin|>{"arg":"value"}<|tool_call_end|><|tool_calls_section_end|>
```

Tool results arrive later as turns whose body is a `## Return of functions.NAME:INDEX` header then the verbatim result:

```text
<|im_system|>NAME<|im_middle|>## Return of functions.NAME:INDEX
verbatim tool result<|im_end|>
```

## Rules

- `NAME` MUST match a listed function exactly.
- Arguments MUST be one JSON object with double-quoted keys.
- Multiple calls = consecutive `<|tool_call_begin|>…<|tool_call_end|>` blocks in the same section; `INDEX` increments from `0`.
- This format has no thinking channel; NEVER emit `<think>` tags.
- Read each result turn in call order. NEVER emit result turns yourself.
- After emitting your tool calls, YOU MUST EMIT THE STOP SEQUENCE AND HALT.
